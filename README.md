# Snippet Sniper

A quick utility to start learning on how to generate snippets from links.

## The web today
- Almost all of the major sites have integrated Open Graph markup.  This alone should get us 80-90% of the way to good snippets.
- Any that have not, abide by good SEO principles so they have strong `<title>`, `<meta description>`, `<h1>` and `<p>` tags.
- Images are hard.  Probably can throw away most `.gif` images (except the funny ones).

## Resources

- [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/)
- [Schema.org](http://schema.org/)
